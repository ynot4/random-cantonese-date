### A random Cantonese date and time generator for practising speaking and writing.

Programmed in **Python** using **Tkinter**, allows some basic customisation.

## Documentation:

When first opened, the program creates a folder in ***Documents\\(ynot)\\random-cantonese-date*** with the configuration files, you can delete them when uninstalling.

The program has a few secret key bindings:

**"n"** to generate a new date and time, and **"c"** to show the current date and time in Chinese.
