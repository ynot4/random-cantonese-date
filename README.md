## Description:

The aim of this simple program is to allow the user to see how dates and time phrases are formed in the Cantonese language. A random date and time is shown and the user has to input the correct English translation of the date for another to be generated.

The program allows you to choose between spoken and written Cantonese, 12 and 24 hour time, male and female text-to-speech voices, and also allows you to customise the colour scheme.

## Documentation:

When first opened, the program creates a folder in ***Documents\\(ynot)\\random-cantonese-date*** with the configuration files, you can delete them when uninstalling.

The program has a few secret key bindings:

**"n"** to generate a new date and time, and **"c"** to show the current date and time in Chinese.
